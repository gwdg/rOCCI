Feature:
  In order to create an OCCI Resource on the OCCI Server
  As an OCCI Client
  I want to get an success report of the create operation and receive the URI of the new Resource by the OCCI Server

  Scenario Outline: Create an OCCI Resource
    Given endpoint : <endpoint>
    And transfer_protocol : <protocol>
    And accept type : <accept_type>
    And have an initialize Client
    And OCCI Kind <occi_kind_identifier> is selected
    When OCCI Client requests OCCI Server to create OCCI Resource with the given kind
    Then the Client should have the response code <response_code>
    And get the URI of the created OCCI Resource
    And the created Resource exist in the OCCI Server

  Scenarios:
    | protocol  | endpoint                  | accept_type       | response_code | occi_kind_identifier                                |
