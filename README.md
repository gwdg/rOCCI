* **only if using Ruby 1.8.7:** libonig-dev (Linux) or oniguruma (Mac)

To use rOCCI with Java, you need JRE 6 or 7. To build rOCCI for Java, you need JDK 6 or 7.

Installation
------------

**[Mac OS X has some special requirements for the installation. Detailed information can be found in
doc/macosx.md.](doc/macosx.md)**

To install the most recent stable version

    gem install occi

To install the most recent beta version

    gem install occi --pre

### Installation from source

To use rOCCI from source it is very much recommended to use RVM. [Install RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/) with

    curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby

#### Ruby

To build and install the bleeding edge version from master

    git clone git://github.com/gwdg/rOCCI.git
    cd rOCCI
    rvm install ruby-1.9.3
    rvm --create --ruby-version use 1.9.3@rOCCI
    bundle install --deployment
    rake install

#### Java

To build a Java jar file from master use

    git clone git://github.com/gwdg/rOCCI.git
    cd rOCCI
    rvm install jruby-1.7.1
    rvm --create --ruby-version use jruby-1.7.1@rOCCI
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    warble

For Linux / Mac OS X you can create a OCCI Java executable from the jar file using

    sudo echo '#!/usr/bin/java -jar' | cat - occi.jar > occi ; sudo chmod +x occi

Usage
-----
### Client
The OCCI gem includes a client you can use directly from shell with the following auth methods: x509 (with --password, --user-cred and --ca-path), basic (with --username and --password), digest (with --username and --password), none. If you won't set a password using --password, the client will ask for it later on. There is also an interactive mode, which will allow you to interact with the client through menus and answers to simple questions (this feature is still experimental).

To find out more about available options and defaults use

    occi --help

To run the client in an interactive mode use

    occi --interactive
    occi --interactive --endpoint https://<ENDPOINT>:<PORT>/
    occi --interactive --endpoint https://<ENDPOINT>:<PORT>/ --auth x509

To list available resources use

    occi --endpoint https://<ENDPOINT>:<PORT>/ --action list --resource compute --auth x509
    occi --endpoint https://<ENDPOINT>:<PORT>/ --action list --resource storage --auth x509
    occi --endpoint https://<ENDPOINT>:<PORT>/ --action list --resource network --auth x509

To describe available resources use

    occi --endpoint https://<ENDPOINT>:<PORT>/ --action describe --resource compute --auth x509
    occi --endpoint https://<ENDPOINT>:<PORT>/ --action describe --resource storage --auth x509
    occi --endpoint https://<ENDPOINT>:<PORT>/ --action describe --resource network --auth x509

To describe specific resources use

    occi --endpoint https://<ENDPOINT>:<PORT>/ --action describe --resource /compute/<OCCI_ID> --auth x509
    occi --endpoint https://<ENDPOINT>:<PORT>/ --action describe --resource /storage/<OCCI_ID> --auth x509

### Client scripting

#### Auth

For Basic auth use

    auth = Hashie::Mash.new
    auth.type = 'basic'
    auth.username = 'user'
    auth.password = 'mypass'
 
For Digest auth use

    auth = Hashie::Mash.new
    auth.type = 'digest'
    auth.username = 'user'
    auth.password = 'mypass'

For X.509 auth use
 
    auth = Hashie::Mash.new
    auth.type = 'x509'
    auth.user_cert = '/Path/To/My/usercert.pem'
    auth.user_cert_password = 'MyPassword'
    auth.ca_path = '/Path/To/root-certificates'

**Deprecated:** For keystone auth use

    auth = Hashie::Mash.new
    auth.type = 'keystone'
    auth.token = '887665443383838'

#### DSL
In your scripts, you can use the OCCI client DSL.

To include the DSL definitions in a script use

    extend Occi::Api::Dsl

To include the DSL definitions in a class use

    include Occi::Api:Dsl

To connect to an OCCI endpoint/server (e.g. running on http://localhost:3300/ )

    # defaults
    options = {
      :endpoint => "http://localhost:3300/",
      :auth => {:type => "none"},
      :log => {:out => STDERR, :level => Occi::Log::WARN, :logger => nil},
      :auto_connect => "value", auto_connect => true,
      :media_type => nil
    }

    connect(:http, options ||= {})

To get the list of available resource, mixin, entity or link types use

    resource_types
    mixin_types
    entity_types
    link_types

To get compute, storage or network descriptions use

    describe "compute"
    describe "storage"
    describe "network"

To get the location of compute, storage or network resources use

    list "compute"
    list "storage"
    list "network"

To get the identifiers of specific mixins in specific mixin types use

    mixin "my_template", "os_tpl"
    mixin "small", "resource_tpl"

To get the identifiers of specific mixins with unknown types use

    mixin "medium"

To get mixin descriptions use

    mixin "medium", nil, true
    mixin "my_template", "os_tpl", true

    mixins
    mixins "os_tpl"
    mixins "resource_tpl"

To create a new compute resource use

    os = mixin 'my_os', 'os_tpl'
    size = mixin 'large', 'resource_tpl'
    cmpt = resource "compute"
    cmpt.mixins << os << size
    cmpt.title = "My VM"
    create cmpt

To get a description of a specific resource use

    describe "/compute/<OCCI_ID>"
    describe "/storage/<OCCI_ID>"
    describe "/network/<OCCI_ID>"

To delete a specific resource use

    delete "/compute/<OCCI_ID>"
    delete "/storage/<OCCI_ID>"
    delete "/network/<OCCI_ID>"

#### API
If you need low level access to parts of the OCCI client or need to use more than one instance
at a time, you should use the OCCI client API directly.

To connect to an OCCI endpoint/server (e.g. running on http://localhost:3300/ )

    # defaults
    options = {
      :endpoint => "http://localhost:3300/",
      :auth => {:type => "none"},
      :log => {:out => STDERR, :level => Occi::Log::WARN, :logger => nil},
      :auto_connect => "value", auto_connect => true,
      :media_type => nil
    }

    client = Occi::Api::Client::ClientHttp.new(options ||= {})

All available categories are automatically registered to the OCCI model during client initialization. You can get them via

    client.model

To get the list of available resource, mixin, entity or link types use

    client.get_resource_types
    client.get_mixin_types
    client.get_entity_types
    client.get_link_types

To get compute, storage or network descriptions use

    client.describe "compute"
    client.describe "storage"
    client.describe "network"

To get the location of compute, storage or network resources use

    client.list "compute"
    client.list "storage"
    client.list "network"

To get the identifiers of specific mixins in specific mixin types use

    client.find_mixin "my_template", "os_tpl"
    client.find_mixin "small", "resource_tpl"

To get the identifiers of specific mixins with unknown types use

    client.find_mixin "medium"

To get mixin descriptions use

    client.find_mixin "medium", nil, true
    client.find_mixin "my_template", "os_tpl", true

To get a list of names of all / OS templates / Resource templates mixins use

    client.get_mixins
    client.get_mixins "os_tpl"
    client.get_mixins "resource_tpl"

To create a new compute resource use

    os = client.find_mixin 'my_os', 'os_tpl'
    size = client.find_mixin 'large', 'resource_tpl'
    cmpt = client.get_resource "compute"
    cmpt.mixins << os << size
    cmpt.title = "My VM"
    client.create cmpt

To get a description of a specific resource use

    client.describe "/compute/<OCCI_ID>"
    client.describe "/storage/<OCCI_ID>"
    client.describe "/network/<OCCI_ID>"

To delete a specific resource use

    client.delete "/compute/<OCCI_ID>"
    client.delete "/storage/<OCCI_ID>"
    client.delete "/network/<OCCI_ID>"

#### Logging

The OCCI gem includes its own logging mechanism using a message queue. By default, no one is listening to that queue.
A new OCCI Logger can be initialized by specifying the log destination (either a filename or an IO object like
STDOUT) and the log level.

    Occi::Log.new(STDOUT,Occi::Log::INFO)

You can create multiple Loggers to receive the log output.

You can always, even if there is no logger defined, log output using the class methods of OCCI::Log e.g.

    Occi::Log.info("Test message")

#### Registering categories in the OCCI Model

Before the parser may be used, the available categories have to be registered in the OCCI Model.

For categories already specified by the OCCI WG a method exists in the OCCI Model class to register them:

    model = Occi::Model.new
    model.register_infrastructure

Further categories can either be registered from files which include OCCI collections in JSON formator or from parsed
 JSON objects (e.g. from the query interface of an OCCI service endpoint).

#### Parsing OCCI messages

The OCCI gem includes a Parser to easily parse OCCI messages. With a given media type (e.g. json,
xml or plain text) the parser analyses the content of the message body and, if supplied,
the message header. As the text/plain and text/occi media type do not clearly distinguish between a message with a
category and a message with an entity which has a kind, it has to be specified if the message contains a category (e
.g. for user defined mixins)

OCCI messages can be parsed to an OCCI collection for example like

    media_type = 'text/plain'
    body = %Q|Category: compute; scheme="http://schemas.ogf.org/occi/infrastructure#"; class="kind"|
    collection=Occi::Parser.parse(media_type, body)

#### Parsing OVF / OVA files

Parsing of OVF/OVA files is partly supported and will be improved in future versions.

The example in [DMTF DSP 2021](http://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP2021_1.0.0.tar) is
bundled with rOCCI and can be parsed to an OCCI collection with

    require 'open-uri'
    ova=open 'https://raw.github.com/gwdg/rOCCI/master/spec/occi/test.ova'
    collection=Occi::Parser.ova(ova.read)

Currently only the following entries of OVF files are parsed

* File in References
* Disk in the DiskSection
* Network in the NetworkSection
* in the VirutalSystemSection:
** Info
** in the VirtualHardwareSection the items regarding
*** Processor
*** Memory
*** Ethernet Adapter
*** Parallel port

### Using the OCCI model

The OCCI gem includes all OCCI Core classes necessary to handly arbitrary OCCI objects.

Changelog
---------

### Version 3.1
* added basic OS Keystone support
* added support for PKCS12 credentials for X.509 authN
* updated templates for plain output formatting
* minor client API changes
* several bugfixes

### Version 3.0

* many bugfixes
* rewrote Core classes to use metaprogramming techniques

### Version 2.4

* Changed OCCI attribute properties from lowercase to first letter uppercase (e.g. type -> Type, default -> Default, ...)

### Version 2.3

* OCCI objects are now initialized with a list of attributes instead of a hash. Thus it is easier to check which
attributes are expected by a class and helps prevent errors.
* Parsing of a subset of the OVF specification is supported. Further parts of the specification will be covered in
future versions of rOCCI.

### Version 2.2

* OCCI Client added. The client simplifies the execution of OCCI commands and provides shortcuts for often used steps.

### Version 2.1

* Several improvements to the gem structure and code documentation. First rSpec test were added. Readme has been extended to include instructions how the gem can be used.

### Version 2.0

* Starting with version 2.0 Florian Feldhaus and Piotr Kasprzak took over the development of the OCCI gem. The codebase was taken from the rOCCI framework and improved to be bundled as a standalone gem.

### Version 1.X

* Version 1.X of the OCCI gem has been developed by retr0h and served as a simple way to access the first OpenNebula OCCI implementation.
